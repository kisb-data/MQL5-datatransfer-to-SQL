# MQL datatransfer to SQL

## About the Project

I made this project to create a library that helps export indicator data into a SQL database. Why is this good? SQL databases are very fast and flexible. The saved data, for example, can be combined with the timestamp as desired and can be used in algorithms based on machine learning. The library primarily helps in the creation of databases and tables, as well as in the insertion of such data. Reading data and merging tables in MQL was not intended.
